# MultiSpeed-Programmable-Fan
Programmed a Microbit embedded system using Python to determine room temperature using thermistor in a voltage-divider electrical circuit. The Microbit used the resistance of the circuit to calculate room temperature and a desirable fan-speed, as well as output digital signal to a transistor to power the fan.
